+ Project summary: Neural networks, although empirically validated, remain a theoretically opaque tool. Once we have trained a particular architecture, what within its layers, neurons, or channels, drive its classification performance? How do we interpret the results beyond out-of-sample loss measures? Feature visualization attempts to elucidate this question by, generally speaking, projecting intermediate layers to pixel-space. In this report, we review and consolidate different methods of feature visualization, their definitions, theoretical approaches and results on three neural network architectures and datasets.
